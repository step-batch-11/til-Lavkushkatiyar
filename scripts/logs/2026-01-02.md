# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
- condtional statements in the shell scripting
- What changed in your understanding?
- i need to learn more about the math behind the simple implementation of object and animations
- What would you explain differently now?
--- math is kind of compoulsory to do realstic animation
# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- i need to learn more about vector .
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- vectors and random maths
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
--- understanding of how to transform the orgin and then make it back normal
lots of funciton in the p5

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because i got exposure about maths and vectors and other
> concept that i thought wasn't part of the programming (eg , acceleartion ,
> vector , radians , angle ). i want to learn more about them .
